For all the bits n pieces I have mangled, broken, put back together or slapped into other things.

These will all be "post mortem" write ups. Most were done either long ago, or recently. I try to photograph any cool parts of what I'm doing to share with friends, but there's sparse documentation on my part. Most, if not all, will be total and complete conflabulations (kinda).

Enjoy.
