<h1>Pi Mirror Rev 1</h1>

My first Pi was built in 2020 in the dingy basement of a house I briefly lived in. It consisted of of a cheap Amazon shadowbox, a *very* old light weight monitor stripped to just the screen, lots of electrical tape, a Raspberry Pi 3, hopes and dreams. It was not pretty; The acrylic for the shadow box was cheap and flimsy. The film haphazardly applied. Any light leaks were taped up with electrical tape. But it was *mine* and *I* made it.

The shadowbox was the most difficult part of it. It was pseudo-wood, but an odd kind of plastic that melted at the slightest concept of heat. This made it incredibly tedious to fit the screen into it and drill holes in the botton to feed the monitor and Pi cables through. Even worse, the monitor was just a mm or two too large, so the inner part of the frame had to be cut to fit the monitor in it. I got it in, but not without a fight from that odd plastic.

Eventually, it fell off the wall and the housing broke entirely, so the salvagable parts were set aside, and the project was shelved. Fortunately, the Pi and screen were unscathed so it would be an easy rehousing.

*I promise I have pics of v1 and v2 somewhere, everything is just kinda everywhere*

<h1>Netbook Mirror Rev 2</h1>

I bought a cheap netbook when it was on sale at Micro Center since I was planning on switching jobs to be a chef at a fraternity house. That never panned out, but I did get a crappy Maestro Evolve III out of it. Never really used it since the specs were too barren, and most distros were too heavy to do much with it besides word processing. At some point, the screen broke from living on/in my couch for months. I thought one day I'd replace the screen but ultimately it wasn't worth it.

A trip to Ikea, a new shadowbox in hand, and a new roll of one way mirror film, I brought it back to life once more. I believe I used Lubuntu since it was light enough that it would run fine. I just reused the same config/modules from my first MM revision making it an easy transition between Rev 1 and 2. I disassembled it leaving the housing for the actual components intact. The acrylic that was provided from the shadowbox was incredibly flimsy. I replaced it with the same sized one from Amazon. Much thicker and sturdier as the old one began to crack from all of the internals leaving visible blemishes through the film. This worked for a while but I hated how it wouldn't sit flush against the wall. I set out to thin it out by removing the thin motherboard from it's protective shell; this was a fatal mistake. Sometime between removing it from the housing and playing with BIOS settings to ensure that if a power outage happened it would reboot on AC, I shorted it. How? Well, you see, the antenna had a glob of solder on it to ground/secure it inside the housing. That ended up wedging itself under the copper heatshield while it was powered on and *blip* - gonezo. In a desperate attempt to get it back to life, I kept unplugging and plugging it back in to the barrel jack (don't ask why, I was desperate to finish this project). On the last power cycle attempt, it began to emmit a high pitched whine that ramped up and I thought to myself "I think this guy wants to rest". It once again, lives on my couch after a recent look-over for any salvagable components.

<h1>Pi Zero 2 W Mirror Rev 3</h1>

Promptly after the death of the netbook board, I got a replacement; a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Since nothing about the housing was broken, it was a smooth transition. Fortunately I had backed up the main config file, so it was just a matter of cloning the modules again and getting the Pi into place. Not much else to say. It's still hanging in my kitchen, working just fine after a 2GB swapfile.
