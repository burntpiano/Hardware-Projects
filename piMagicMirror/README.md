<h1>Pi Mirror Rev 1</h1>

My first Pi was built in 2020 in the dingy basement of a house I briefly lived in. It consisted of of a cheap Amazon shadowbox, a *very* old light weight monitor, lots of electrical tape, a Raspberry Pi 3, hopes and dreams. It was not pretty; The acrylic for the shadow box was cheap and flimsy. The film haphazardly applied. Any light leaks were taped up with electrical tape. But it was *mine* and *I* made it.
